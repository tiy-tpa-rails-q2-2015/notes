# Week 8 - Assignment 3

Ruby Koans revisited. The first time through, you got a lot of exposure, but you had very little context for the things you were seeing. Going back through these should make a lot more sense. Remember that the Koans are about practice. Think about both the code you're working on and using your text editor proficiently.

- [ ] [Rename your original](https://help.github.com/articles/renaming-a-repository/) Koans fork to something else, e.g. `koans_old` or `koans_week_1`.
- [ ] Fork the [Ruby Koans](https://github.com/tiy-tpa-rails-q2-2015/koans) repository to your own GitHub account again.
- [ ] Run `rake` and begin your journey.
- [ ] **Optional**: Install Observr to help automate the process. There are details about this in the `README`. Just replace `watchr` with `observr`
- [ ] **Bonus**: Complete Ruby Koans in their entirety.
- [ ] Close this issue to notify me for review. Be sure to include a link to your repository.
