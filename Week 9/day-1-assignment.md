# Week 9 - Assignment 1

## Integrating 3rd-Party SaaS tools

Many companies provide "Software as a Service" (SaaS) tools to developers. Let's check some out.

- [ ] Pick any one of your apps you've worked on so far, your blog app, one of the weekend projects, etc.
- [ ] Setup [New Relic](https://addons.heroku.com/newrelic) in your app for Performance Monitoring.
- [ ] Setup some [external error tracking](https://addons.heroku.com/#errors-exceptions). I really like [Honeybadger](https://www.honeybadger.io/) (though there's no free option) and [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/), but I'm interested in checking out [Raygun](http://raygun.io/).
- [ ] Bonus: Setup some additional analytics, like [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics) or [Keen.io](https://keen.io/) (also available as a [Heroku addon](https://addons.heroku.com/keen)). Alternatively, checkout [Segment](https://segment.com/) as a way to configure multiple analytics and more.
