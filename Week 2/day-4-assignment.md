# Week 4 - Day 4

### Description

One of the basic, foundational skills in being a professional web developer is the translation of a designer's mockup image into a web page with HTML and CSS. One of the basic, foundational news portals for professional web developers is "Hacker News," which is kind of like a Reddit for the startup/design/development community with a very... *minimalist* design ethic.

Since it's so simple (there's only one image!) we're going to start off here.

At the same time, we're also going to get into the habit of frequently creating git commits as checkpoints.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be comfortable with

* Translating images/PSDs to HTML and CSS
* Hosting static pages on GitHub
* Using git on the command line
* Best practices for committing frequently

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use

* Chrome developer tools
* GitHub pages
* Terminal
* git
* Your text editor of choice

## Details

### Deliverables

* A GitHub pages-hosted repo containing
    - [ ] `index.html`
    - [ ] `index.css`
    - [ ] All images in an `assets/images` folder

### Requirements

- [ ] Valid, semantic, accessible HTML
- [ ] Valid CSS
- [ ] At least one git commit (with a message) every hour that you're working on this project
            
Using HTML and CSS, re-create the above image as a static web page. Don't worry about the text content (feel free to use a lorem ipsum generator), but use the original image and **make _your best effort_ to match the dimensions and styles of original page**.
         
Here's the only image asset you need for your page:
