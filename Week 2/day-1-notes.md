We took the Caffeine challenge from the `rb-assignments` repo and worked on it as a class. Each student took turns driving for 10-15 minutes each. I tried to guide as little as possible and have them help each other implement the program.

Some of them told me afterwards that the exercise was immensely valuable, and the most productive learning they've had yet. Win!
