## Week 2 - Assignment 3

### Description

Using the blog layout you created in yesterday's assignment (or creating a new one) I want you to build a web app that loads blog posts from a data file in YAML format.

Use Webrick to serve the pages on port 8000.

### Deliverables

- [ ] a git repo containing:
    - [ ] `public` folder containing
        - [ ] `styles` folder with `style.css`
        - [ ] `images` folder with at least 2 images
        - [ ] `index.html` that links to `/blog`
    - [ ] a `blog.rb` file
    - [ ] a `post.yml` file

### Requirements

- [ ] a working website. It does not need to be publicly visible, but it should run on `localhost`.
- [ ] at least two "blog posts" loaded from a data file (`posts.yml`).
- [ ] each post should have a title, an accompanying image, and body text.

### Objectives

- familiarize yourself with ERB
- familiarize yourself with Reading files in ruby
- familiarize yourself with the YAML data format *Hint: search for 'reading yaml ruby'*

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to create a dynamic site from scratching using only tools from Ruby's standard library.

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively:

- create ERB templates
- create and read `yaml` files
- use Webrick to serve static and dynamic assets
- use the Internet to research documentation for Ruby's standard libraries
