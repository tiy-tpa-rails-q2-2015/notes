## Week 3 - Assignment 2

### Description

This assignment serves to reinforce JS syntax, functions, and some mathematical operators and sequences.

After completing this assignment, you should:

* Understand general JS syntax
* Grasp why functions are important
* Understand arrays and loops
* Be able to breakdown a simple process of mathematical steps into a series of statements in JS
* be able to effectively use the terminal and `node` to test your JS

### Details

* - [ ] A gist containing your changes to `functions_1.js` from our [Bananas repository](https://github.com/tiy-tpa-rails-q2-2015/bananas/tree/master/js).
* - [ ] All functions should be complete and produce the expected output.
* - [ ] Complete the problems section II.
* - [ ] Complete the problems section III.

Instead of using the browser and the Chrome Dev Tools console to look at your JS output, use `node functions_1.js` to print the output to your terminal.

## Bonus

Write a function in another javascript file (`fizzbuzz.js`) that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.

Turn this in as a gist as well.

_Hint: Research the `%` (modulo) operator._
