Gavin Stark guest lectured on ruby's Enumerable, and we created an assignment to do some analysis on the words in "Green
Eggs and Ham" for homework. Gavin's lecture was great, here's the feedback I gave Toni on it:

> * Gavin's lesson was expertly executed and clearly well planned.
> * He spoke clearly and deliberately to the students and kept everyone's focus, including the ones I know to have wandering attention spans.
> * Gavin was impressed with the class, and said he got insightful questions from all the students; I greatly attribute this to the clear way he presented the material.
> * Gavin and I prepared the homework assignment related to his lesson together and the students have been able to execute somewhat complex operations with enumerable with impressive confidence.
>
> Honestly, it's hard for me to give an unbiased review of Gavin's lecture. As co-organizers of the Tampa Ruby Brigade, we have a great rapport and are often perfectly in sync when we work together to develop content and presentations for the group.
