## Week 3 - Assignment 1

Continue working with your Iron News website. We're going to convert the HTML and CSS to use Slim and Sass.

Look to our [Eat THIS!](https://github.com/tiy-tpa-rails-q2-2015/eat_this) repo for inspiration!

- [ ] You'll need a `Gemfile`, use `bundle init` to make a blank one.
- [ ] Manually setup Slim to replace your `index.html.erb` with `index.slim`
- [ ] Manually setup Sass to replace your `/public/styles.css` with `stylesheet.sass`
- [ ] Remove your old erb and css file.
- [ ] Make sure your code follows the style guide!
- **Bonus**
  - [ ] Deploy your app to Heroku!
- [ ] Close this issue to notify me for review. Be sure to include a link to your repository and/or deploy app.
