Front end conf starts tomorrow, so we dove into Javascript
The first hour was a total train-wreck for me, it's the first
time I've ever felt like I was talking "at" the class.

We took a 20 minute break, so I could figure out how to fix
the lesson. I dug through the js assignments repo and found
a few introductory homework assignments. We have a guest lecture
Thursday (yes, TWO this week!) on Enumerable in ruby, so I picked
the JS assignment that covered the same topic.

We switched modes to group coding. And worked through part I of
that assignment with students taking turns driving. The rest of
the afternoon went well and I assigned parts II and III as homework.
