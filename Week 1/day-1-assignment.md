## Week 1 - Assignment #1

- [ ] Read Mason's [Code School Manefesto](http://masondesu.github.io/code-school-manifesto/).
- [ ] Look over this [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide). You don't need to commit it all to memory. You probably won't understand all of it; that's okay. Just skim it, know that it exists, bookmark it, and refer to it often as we move forward.
- [ ] Complete the just the six exercises given below by copying the comments to a new file  (`day_one.rb`) and placing your solution below each comment.
- [ ] Publish your completed exercises to a Github Gist.
- **Bonus**
  - [ ] Clone the Gist you created to your computer.
  - [ ] Add the bonus exercises (7 and 8) to your `day_one.rb` and attempt to complete them both.
  - [ ] Push your changes (even if incomplete) back to Gist.
- [ ] Spend some more time getting to know your terminal and text editor. Try finding some color schemes you like online and installing them. I like to match my editor and terminal colors.
- [ ] Close this issue to notify me for review. 

`day_one.rb`:

```ruby
# 1. Assign "Hello World" to a variable message.

# 2. Assign a different string to a different variable.

# 3. Assign a number to a variable.

# 4. Use string interpolation to display the number from exercise 3 in a string.

# 5. Make an array of at least four of your favorite movies or books or bands.

# 6. Make a hash of information about yourself with at least four key-value pairs.
```

### Bonus Exercises

```ruby
# 7. Make an array of hashes containing more information about your favorite movies. The hashes should have at least three key value pairs.

# 8. Use `each` to loop through the answer from exercise #7 and print only one property from the hash. i.e., given `{ title: "Gone with the Wind" }` you print "Gone with the Wind".
```
